### **Welcome to Basetec!** üëã

Basetec is a space for ideas, technological support, academic collaboration, and business support.

What we mainly do:

Scope 1: **Genomic data analysis and Quality Control (QC)**
   - **Data Processing:** We process raw sequencing data from standardized 'FASTQ' files, examining for technical biases or anomalies during sample and library preparation, as well as sequencing.
   - **Quality Control:** This includes spotting unexpected indices and aligning data across multiple reference genomes to keep things accurate.

Scope 2: **Customized data processing solutions**
   - **QC and Pipelines:** Basetec delivers quality control measures and data processing pipelines, encompassing tasks like sequence read refinement, mapping, quantification, variant identification, and reporting.
   - **Custom-made solution:** We also accommodate pipeline development as per client requirements.

Scope 3: **Strategic experimental design and statistical insights**
   - **Experimental Guidance:** We provide guidance in implementing experimental designs for mRNA-seq, miRNA-seq, and total RNA-seq experiments.
   - **Bioinformatics Consultation:** We emphasize the critical role of statistical considerations in ensuring meaningful data generation, offering bioinformatic and statistical consultation services before project begins.
   - **RNA-seq Analysis:** For RNA-seq endeavors, our analysis extends to identifying differentially expressed genes and isoforms, with data visualization techniques such as PCA, Venn diagrams, Volcano plots, and heatmaps.
   - **Advanced Analysis:** We are equipped to engage in detailed statistical analyses to individual project needs, including gene ontology and pathway analysis, on a consultative basis.

Scope 4: **Secure data management and transfer** (Future plan)
   - **Data Storage Compliance:** We are planning to provide platforms ensuring long-term storage compliance with upcoming regulations (upon agreement) for FASTQ files, accessible via our LIMS system and retrievable upon request.
   - **GEO Submission Support:** In addition, we will offer support for GEO submission for projects analyzed by Basetec.
