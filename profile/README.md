1. **Genomic Data Analysis and Quality Control**
   - We process raw sequencing data into standardized 'FASTQ' files, examining for technical biases or anomalies during sample and library preparation, as well as sequencing.
   - This includes detecting unexpected indices and aligning data across multiple reference genomes.

2. **Secure Data Management and Transfer**
   - Our platform ensures long-term storage compliance with upcoming regulations (upon agreement) for FASTQ files, accessible via our LIMS system and retrievable upon request.
   - Additionally, we offer support for GEO submission for projects analyzed by Basetec.

3. **Customized Data Processing Solutions**
   - Basetec delivers quality control measures and data processing pipelines, encompassing tasks like sequence read refinement, mapping, quantification, variant identification, and comprehensive reporting.
   - We also accommodate pipeline development as per client requirements.

4. **Strategic Experimental Design and Statistical Insight**
   - We provide guidance in implementing experimental designs for mRNA-seq, miRNA-seq, and total RNA-seq experiments.
   - We emphasize the critical role of statistical considerations in ensuring meaningful data generation, offering bioinformatic and statistical consultation services before project begins.
   - For RNA-seq endeavors, our analysis extends to identifying differentially expressed genes and isoforms, with data visualization techniques such as PCA, Venn diagrams, Volcano plots, and heatmaps.
   - We're equipped to engage in detailed statistical analyses to individual project needs, including gene ontology and pathway analysis, on a consultative basis.
